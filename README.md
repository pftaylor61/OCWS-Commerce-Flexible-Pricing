## Description

The plugin allows the customer to give his own price and proceed with the checkout. You can easily set the minimum price for your woocommerce products both globally and individually.<br /><br />This plugin is a fork of 'ELEX Woocommerce Name Your Price' from ELEX Extensions (https://elextensions.com/). It has been forked to be adapted for Classic Commerce. All the hard work has been done by ELEX, with just a couple of lines changed by me, in order to make the plugin work with Classic Commerce.

The original Woocommerce version, which Elex will be updating normally, is available at [https://elextensions.com/plugin/elex-woocommerce-name-your-price-plugin-free/](https://elextensions.com/plugin/elex-woocommerce-name-your-price-plugin-free/) Elex's original [elex-readme.txt](elex-readme.txt) is included in this plugin.

## Installation

1. Ensure WooCommerce or Classic Commerce is installed and active.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress or ClassicPress.

You will find that general Name Your Price options are available in the Commerce Settings. Product specific Name Your Price options can be found in the edit product panel.

## Changelog

### 1.2.0
Initial release of the new fork. Elextensions have been informed of the fork. Although the plugin was not on GitHub, as far as I could see, it was licensed with a GPLv2 license, which permits forking. The new code has been provided to Elex.
